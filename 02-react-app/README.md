# LazyLoad - Chunks - React-Router-Dom V5
This section makes use of LazyLoad for a full component module.

Using lazyLoad we can load each of our components independently or on demand (lazyLoad through components and lazyLoad through a master page or main layout, complete modules). The use of these will depend on the needs and experience of users.
